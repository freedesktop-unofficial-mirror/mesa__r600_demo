R600_DEMO

	DRM/DRI exercise utility

	This is a bringup utility for learning how to program r6xx cards. It
	has no value for you if you are not a hardware driver hacker. Except
	for that it (hopefully) will draw a single triangle for you :-P

	The original skeleton for r600_demo was r300_demo, but there's almost
	none (literally) code left from these days.

	The r600_demo code is provided without any warranty and in
	understanding that direct access to the hardware can lead to permanent
	damage to the hardware (or even damage to the user - say from locked up
	laser displays).
	The software is meant for experimentation and thus one should not
	expect it to be checked for compatibility or suitability for any
	purpose.


STATE

	- DRM state dump                                                     ok
	  DRM setup works - DRM shows some issues, still, GART
	  texture space has a wrong GPU address assigned, etc.

	Tested on R600, RV610, RV620, RV630, RV635, RV670, RV710, RV730, RV770


SETUP:

	Requirements:

	- r600_demo from git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/r600_demo

	- An r6xx or r7xx card, testing happens mostly on
	  RV610, RV670, and RV770. R600 is probably the least supported.

	- Install + configure radeonhd:
	  Get the latest driver (1.2.4 is good enough). Explicitly enable
	  DRI and disable 2D acceleration:

	  Option "DRI"
	  Option "AccelMethod" "none"

	- Install DRM:
	  Get and install the r6xx-r7xx-support branch of DRM.


RUNNING:

	- Run the Xserver. No additional clients needed (r600_demo is not an X
	  client, so no server reset occurs).
	- Call r600_demo on the same machine as root(!).

	./r600_demo

	  This will print out the usage, including all options.

	./r600_demo ""

	  This will print out the state of DRM and the graphics card
	  (busy flags + ring and buffer states). Add '-v' to get a list of all
	  mapped memory regions and a more verbose state output.

	./r600_demo pc

	  Will test the CP, and clear the screen.

	./r600_demo t

	  Draws two Gouraud shaded triangles.

	./r600_demo r

	  This resets the engine. "./r600_demo rct" is a typical call, because
	  the 't' and 'q' tests do not invaldiate the shaders correctly yet.

	./r600_demo rcqE

	  Draws a textured quad, and then invokes the EXA copy test, which
	  copies the top left corner 3 times.

	./r600_demo "" 30000-3001c

	  Register dump: prints out the first two ALU constants
	  (SQ_ALU_CONSTANT0_0 - SQ_ALU_CONSTANT3_1). Any number of single
	  registers and ranges allowed.
	  You can lock up the whole machine when accessing non-existent
	  register space, so beware.

	make dump

	  Create a register dump of known registers.
